NAME
    errors - Error Handling for Perl

STATUS
    This module is still under design. Don't use it in production yet.

SYNOPSIS
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use errors;

        try {
            throw Error("Something is not cool")
                if $uncool;
        }
        catch Error with {
            my $e = shift;
            warn $e;
        }
        except {
            my $e = shift;
            print "Some other error: $e";
        }
        finally {
            cleanup();
        };

DESCRIPTION
    The "error" module adds clean, simple, sane, flexible and usable error
    handling to Perl.

    Currently it is almost an exact proxy for Error.pm. It gets rid of the
    Error::Simple base class, and allows you to use 'Error' as the top base
    class.
